Tenant AOA is used for a HUB deployment, a shared resource HUB.
- This is similar to HUB, just deployed into a different Tenant
- This closely resembles a shared resources development HUB
- Hub in includes subscription scope resources and global resources
- This should be up to date for most schema references
- However this is not specific resource examples, such as the spoke deployments/tenants below
  - SFM, PST, HUB, GW, LAB are all newer than these examples
